# divisible-numbers
This is a simple project usign JavaScript to iterate from 0 to 100 and help find the dividible numbers by 3 and 5 in between.
It is self automated meaning you don't need to give any inputs, so it is just going to print Hello if the number it is divisible by 3
(i also added the number so we could see which is) and is going to print World if the number is divisible by 5
